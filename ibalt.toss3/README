This is a build which (at the rpm spec level) leaves the ib package dependencies
unspecified on purpose. It can accomodate a variety of alternate ib stacks such as mofed,
but the onus is on the user to make sure the rpms created are deployed only in 
enviroments which will satisfy the unstated Requires.

Use at your own risk.
